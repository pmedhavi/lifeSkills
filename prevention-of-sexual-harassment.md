## What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?
Repression of sexual liberty and freedom mainly causes sexual harassment.

## What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?
In case of witnessing problematic behavior, I would prioritize safety, assess the situation, and intervene if appropriate. For repeated incidents, I would seek resolution through dialogue, support, or reporting to relevant authorities.
